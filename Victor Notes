Debugging:

The motor won't turn on, so I put print statements in the interrupt service registers to verify that the pull-up resistor switch is working 
properly.

The ISR works right, but the motor isn't turning on, which makes us think that its a cicruit issue

  pinMode(m1PWM_pin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(m2PWM_pin, OUTPUT);
  attachInterrupt(state_user_pin, motorON_ISR, RISING);
  attachInterrupt(state_user_pin, motorOFF_ISR, FALLING);
  attachInterrupt(m1_user_pin, m1forwardISR, RISING);
  attachInterrupt(m1_user_pin, m1backwardISR, FALLING);
  attachInterrupt(m2_user_pin, m2forwardISR, RISING);
  attachInterrupt(m2_user_pin, m2backwardISR, FALLING);

Turns out that we need to use the CHANGE instead because this code ^ overwrites the rising edge interrupt with the falling edge one
The motor won't turn on even when I make the code directly turn it on, I think it is a circuit issue because I tried to activate a motor in main and it didn't go on, and the power source was plugged in when I used this code:

digitalWrite(m1direction_pin, HIGH);
analogWrite(m1PWM_pin, max_power);

I'm gonna start debugging by making sure that the voltages are at the correct points in the IC

We suspect that the zener diodes are not in the correct orientation, they might be in forward bias

Turns out that all the zener diodes have the opposite polarity than they should have

The diodes are in the right orientation, but the motor still won't turn on

Motor Class Requirements:
- Motor turn function
- Motor stop function
- Both PWM direction Pins
